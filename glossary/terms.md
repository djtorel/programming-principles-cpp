# Personal glossary of C++ terms

## **//**
> The inline comment token. Comments are ignored by the compiler and written for the benefit of programmers who read 
> the code. Comments are written to describe what the program is intended to do and in general to provide information
> useful for humans that can't be directle expressed in code. Good comments help those who need to come into the code
> and understand what is going on. Especially useful for me if I come back later and don't remember all of the logic.
---

## **<<**
> Output operator. Used to pass strings or variables to the cout iostream function. Is also used for other things in C++
> such as bitwise shifting.
---

## **C++**
> C++ is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features,
> while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It was designed with a bias towards system
> programming and embedded, resource-constrained and large systems, with performance, efficiency and flexibility of use
> as its design highlights. C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest
> standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2014 as ISO/IEC 14882:2014 (informally known as C++14).
---

## **Compiler**
> A compiler turns human-readable text files containing source code into binary objects or machine language files that can
> be understood by computers.
---

## **Compile time error**
> Errors found by the compiler. Generally contain syntax errors, and type checking errors. Almost always caused by errors
> in source code.
---

## **cout**
> The name cout refers to a standard output stream. Characters "put into cout" will appear on the screen. Short for 
> "character output stream."
---

## **Executable**
> Executables are binary objects created by the compiler. They can be executed by the computer.
---

## **Function**
> A named unit of code that can be invoked (called) from different parts of a program. A logical unit of computation.
---

## **Header**
> A file containing declarations used to share interfaces between parts of a program.
---

## **IDE**
> Interactive Development Environment, or Integrated Development Environment. Such as Visual Studio.
---

## **#include**
> Insructs the computer to make available ("to include") facilities from the given header or library
---

## **Library**
> A library is some code - usually written by others - that we access using declartions in an **#include**d file.
---

## **Linker**
> A program that combines object code files and libraries into an executable program.
---

## **main()**
> The main function. Required by all C++ programs, and is the entry point for the program beeing created.
---

## **Object Code**
> Code produced by a compiler or assembler. In a general sense object code is a squence of statements or instructions in
> a computer language, usually a machine code language (i.e. binary).
---

## **Output**
> Values produced by a computation (e.g., a function result or lines of characters written on a screen).
---

## **Program**
> Code that is sufficiently complete to be executed by a computer.
---

## **Source Code**
> Code as produced by a programmer and (in principle) readable by other programmers.
---

## **Statement**
> The smallest standalone element that expresses some action to be carried out. It is an instruction written in a high-level
> language that commands the computer to perform a specified action.
